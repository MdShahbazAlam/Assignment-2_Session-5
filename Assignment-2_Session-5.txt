Problem Statement:

1. Calculate the P Value for the test in Problem 2.
Answer-
# Calculating the p-value for the previous problem
prop.test(1755, 1755 + 2771, p = 0.4, alternative = "less",
          conf.level = 0.99, correct = FALSE)

# Result
1-sample proportions test without continuity correction

data:  1755 out of 1755 + 2771, null probability 0.4
X-squared = 2.8255, df = 1, p-value = 0.04639
alternative hypothesis: true p is less than 0.4
99 percent confidence interval:
 0.0000000 0.4047326
sample estimates:
        p 
0.3877596

# p-value i.e. 0.04639 is greater than alpha i.e. 0.01

2. How do you test the propotions and compare against hypothetical props? Test Hypothesis: proportion of automatic cars
is 40%.
Answer-
# Null Hypothesis : Proportion of automatic cars is 40%.

str(mtcars)
table(mtcars$am)

prop.test(13, 32, p = 0.4, alternative = "less",
          conf.level = 0.95, correct = FALSE)

# Result

1-sample proportions test without continuity correction

data:  13 out of 32, null probability 0.4
X-squared = 0.0052083, df = 1, p-value = 0.5288
alternative hypothesis: true p is less than 0.4
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.0000000 0.5508812
sample estimates:
      p 
0.40625

# At confidence level of 0.95, since p- value is greater than alpha, 
# we fail to reject the null hypothesis
